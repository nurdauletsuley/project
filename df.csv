18,Disney , Refl,"Look at me, I may never pass for a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter. Can it be, I'm not meant to play this part? Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself, I would break my family's heart.Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me? Why is my reflection someone I don't know? Somehow I cannot hide? Who I am, though I've tried. When will my reflection show, who I am, inside? How I pray, that a time will come, I can free myself, from their expectations On that day, I'll discover someway to be myself, and to make my family proud.

When the evening shadows and the stars appear And there is no one there to dry your tears I could hold you for a million yearsTo make you feel my love. I know you haven't made your mind up yet But I would never do you wrong. I've known it from the moment that we met No doubt in my mind where you belong. I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue I'd go crawling down the avenue.No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do To make you feel my love.The storms are raging on the rolling sea And on the highway of regret. Though winds of change are throwing wild and free You ain't seen nothing like me yet.I could make you happy, make your dreams come true. Nothing that I wouldn't do. Go to the ends of the Earth for you To make you feel my love To make you feel my love..."

87,Ted Gärdestad , Himlen Är Oskyldigt Blå,"Himlen är oskyldigt blå,  Som ögon när barnen är små. Att regndroppar faller som tårarna gör,  Rår inte stjärnorna för. Älskling jag vet hur det känns,  När broar till tryggheten bränns. Fast tiden har jagat oss in I en vrå,  Är himlen så oskyldigt blå.När vi växte upp, lekte livet,  Vi var evighetens hopp. Det var helt självklart att vår Framtid skulle bli,  Oförbrukat fri.Somrar svepte fram,  Jorden värmde våra fötter där vi sprang Rågen gungade, och gräset växte grönt. Hela livet var så skönt.Himlen är oskyldigt blå,  Som ögon när barnen är små. Att regndroppar faller som tårarna gör,  Det rår inte stjärnorna för. Älskling, jag vet hur det känns,  När broar till tryggheten bränns. Fast tiden har jagat oss in I en vrå,  Är himlen så oskyldigt blå.Frusna på en strand,  Flög vi med drakar medans Tiden flöt iland. Vi var barn som ingen ondska kunde nå Himlen var så blåNu tar molnen mark. Jag var förblindad av att solen sken så stark. Men mina ögon kommer alltid le mot dig. Kan det begäras mer av mig.Himlen är oskyldigt blå,  Djupaste hav likaså. Att regndroppar faller som tårarna gör,  Det rår inte stjärnorna för. Älskling, jag vet hur det känns,  När broar till tryggheten bränns. Fast tiden har jagat, oss in I en vrå. Är himlen så oskyldigt blå"

He sought me and bought me With His redeeming blood; He loved me ere I knew Him And all my love is due Him, He plunged me to victory, Beneath the cleansing flood.I heard about His healing, Of His cleansing pow'r revealing. How He made the lame to walk again And caused the blind to see; And then I cried, ""Dear Jesus, Come and heal my broken spirit,"" And somehow Jesus came and bro't To me the victory.Chorus O victory in Jesus, My Savior, forever. He sought me and bought me With His redeeming blood; He loved me ere I knew Him And all my love is due Him, He plunged me to victory, Beneath the cleansing flood.I heard about a mansion He has built for me in glory. And I heard about the streets of gold Beyond the crystal sea; About the angels singing, And the old redemption story, And some sweet day I'll sing up there The song of victory.Chorus O victory in Jesus, My Savior, forever. He sought me and bought me With His redeeming blood; He loved me ere I knew Him And all my love is due Him, He plunged me to victory, Beneath the cleansing flood."

235,Baz Luhrmann , Everybody's Free (to Wear Sunscreen),"Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of '99 Wear Sunscreen If I could offer you only one tip for the future, Sunscreen would be it The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience... I will dispense this advice now...Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked...You are not as fat as you imagine Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mindthe kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle TuesdayDo one thing everyday that scares youSing Don't be reckless with other people's heartsdon't put up with people who are reckless with yoursFloss Don't waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind...the race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insultsif you succeed in doing this, tell me howKeep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statementsStretch Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life... the most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don'tGet plenty of calcium Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're gone Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary... what ever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either your choices are half chance, so are everybody else'sEnjoy your bodyuse it every way you can...don't be afraid of it, or what other people think of itit's the greatest instrument you'll ever ownDance...even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room Read the directions, even if you don't follow them Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel uglyGet to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good Be nice to your siblings they are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the futureUnderstand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestylebecause the older you get the more you need the people you knew when you were young Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft Travel Accept certain inalienable truths prices will rise politicians will philander you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable politicians were noble and children respected their elders Respect your elders Don't expect anyone else to support you Maybe you have a trust fund maybe you have a wealthy spouse but you never know when either one might run out Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40, it will look 85 Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it Advice is a form of nostalgia dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth But trust me on the sunscreen"

Seasons of love (love)...Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes. Five hundred twenty five thousand journeys to plan. Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes. How do you measure a life of a woman or a man?In truths that she learned, or in times that he cried? In bridges he burned, or the way that she died?It's time now to sing out, though the story never ends. Let's celebrate remember a year in a life of friendsRemember the love... (Oh, you've got to you've got to remember the love) Remember the love... (You know the love is a gift from up above) Remember the love... (Share love, give love, spray love, measure your life in love.) Seasons of love... Seasons of love..."

342,Dying Fetus , From Womb to Waste,"Burning urge to conceive like animals blind in heat But they're human all the same copulation compulsion to breed, just anatomy and instinct lust consumed but the product is a human life. A malicious maternal seed spewed forth in precarious birth from the womb into the trash. Precious, twisting life, crawling on the filth of the dumpster floor. Only known to the mother in guilt, as she stumbles from the alley covered in flies. With a ten mile stare dead to the world she never gave one fuck for the child inside... none. Sucks the crack pipe in shame just to forget. Yet with another hit, she's on the streets again in another life she once had hope. But that went down the drain. Along with her pride. Nurses habitually resigned. Tossing the carcass, in the waste bin death legally designed? Or fixing the future with quick extraction? Conceived and thrown away from womb into the waste. Human trash, putrid, the bodies overrun. Aborted removal, with cold precision. Tools specifically designed forcing fetal termination. Blind the morally enraged. Bomb the clinic into oblivion. Kill the killer they will say. Justice through murder goes both ways. Conceived and thrown away from womb into the waste. One more girl, mortified. Never knew what was growing within. Obese, diseased, down on her knees she gave birth on the toilet seat. Insert anesthetize. Late term feticide. Orphan spawned from rape. Short lived, half a face. Crackhead whore for host. Hatching living ghosts. Pregnant, drunk and high. It was no surprise, when she left it there to die. One more girl who could never conceive. Psychopath, maternity-mad. Took a steel bat to her mother's head, hacked her up and took the baby out. One more girl, six months in, takes a hanger and a bottle of pills. The pro-life priest has nothing to say as the embryo's scraped away. Straight into the trash with the unborn offspring, generations dead in time, progeny unwanted. Dead flesh pile a mass of cells, 10 more bags and the landfill swells. Ripened mass fetal decay, no one cares were they human anyway?"
343,Sentenced , No One There,"The axe, the bottle, and the rope The feeling there really is no more hope The thought of the great unknown And facing it alone The dark, the silent, and the cold The feeling I have come to the end of my road Yes these are the things I spend my remaining moments withAnd the wind blows through my heart Shivers me one last time As I now reach out in the dark No one thereWhy did it have to be so hard For us to live our lives Again I reach out in the dark in despairThe desperation and the snow The feeling of finally coming back home The melancholy and the hole in the soil so hard and coldAnd the wind blows through my heart Shivers me one last time As I now reach out in the dark No one thereYour love for me, my love for you Things we somehow managed to lose Now there's only the ruthless wind To blow right through If freezes my heart, my desperate heart If freezes my heart, my desperate heart If freezes my heart, my desperate heart To think we both will die aloneAnd the wind blows through my heart Shivers me one last time As I now reach out in the dark No one there"

I will dispense this advice now...Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked...You are not as fat as you imagine Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mindthe kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle TuesdayDo one thing everyday that scares youSing Don't be reckless with other people's heartsdon't put up with people who are reckless with yoursFloss Don't waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind...the race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insultsif you succeed in doing this, tell me howKeep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statementsStretch Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life... the most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don'tGet plenty of calcium Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're gone Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary... what ever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either your choices are half chance, so are everybody else'sEnjoy your bodyuse it every way you can...don't be afraid of it, or what other people think of itit's the greatest instrument you'll ever ownDance...even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room Read the directions, even if you don't follow them Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel uglyGet to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good Be nice to your siblings they are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the futureUnderstand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestylebecause the older you get the more you need the people you knew when you were young Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft Travel Accept certain inalienable truths prices will rise politicians will philander you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable politicians were noble and children respected their elders Respect your elders Don't expect anyone else to support you Maybe you have a trust fund maybe you have a wealthy spouse but you never know when either one might run out Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40, it will look 85 Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it Advice is a form of nostalgia dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth But trust me on the sunscreen"

Moi pour lui dans la vie Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vie. Et dès que je l'aperçoisAlors je sens en moi Mon coeur qui bat Des nuits d'amour a plus finirUn grand bonheur qui prend sa place Des enuis des chagrins, s'effacent Heureux, heureux a en mourir. Quand il me prend dans ses brasIl me parle tout bas Je vois la vie en rose. Il me dit des mots d'amourDes mots de tous les jours Et ça me fait quelque chose. Il est entré dans mon coeur Une part de bonheur Dont je connais la cause. C'est toi pour moi. Moi pour toi dans la vie Il me l'a dit, l'a juré pour la vieuuuh.

585,Ray Stevens , Mississippi Squirrel Revival,"Verse 1Well when I was kid I'd take a trip every summer, down to Mississippi. To visit my granny in her ante bellum world. I'd run barefooted all day long, climbing trees free as a song. One day I happened catch myself a squirrel. I stuffed him down in an old shoebox, punched a couple holes in the top and when Sunday came, I snuck him into church. I was sittin way back in the very last pew showin him to my good buddy Hugh, when that squirrel got loose and went totally berserk!Well what happened next is hard to tell. Some thought it was Heaven others thought it was Hell. But the fact that something was among us was plain to see.As the choir sang ""I Surrender All"" the squirrel ran up Harv Newlan's coveralls Harv leaped to his feet and said, ""Somethin's got a hold on me! YEOW!""ChorusThe day the squirrel went berserk, In the First Self-Righteous Church in that sleepy little town of Pascagoula. It was a fight for survival, that broke out in revival. They were jumpin pews and shouting Hallelujah!Verse 2Well, Harv hit the aisles dancin' and screamin' Some thought he had religion Others thought he had a demon And Harv thought he had a weed eater loose in his Fruit-Of-The-Looms He fell to his knees to plead and beg And the squirrel ran out of his britches leg, Unobserved, to the other side of the roomAll the way down to the amen pew, Where sat Sister Bertha better-than-you, Who'd been watchin' all the commotion with sadistic glee But you should've seen the look in her eyes When that squirrel jumped her garters and crossed her thighs She jumped to her feet and said ""Lord have mercy on me"" As the squirrel made laps inside her dress She began to cry and then to confess to sins that would make a sailor blush with shame She told of gossip and church dissension but the thing that got the most attention Was when she talked about her love life And then she started naming names!ChorusThe day the squirrel went berserk. In the First Self-Righteous Church in that sleepy little town of Pascagoula. It was a fight for survival, that broke out in revival. They were jumpin pews and shouting Hallelujah!Verse 3Well seven deacons and then the pastor got saved and 25, 000 dollars got raised. And 50 volunteered for missions in the Congo on the spot. and even without an invitation there were at least 500 rededications. And we all got re-baptized whether we needed it or not.Now you've heard the Bible stories I guess of how He parted the waters for Moses to pass. All the miracles God has brought to this ol' world. But the one I'll remember to my dyin day is how he put that church back on the narrow way with a half-crazed Mississippi squirrelThe day the squirrel went berserk. In the First Self-Righteous Church Of that sleepy little town of Pascagoula. It was a fight for survival, that broke out in revival. They were jumpin pews and shouting Halelujah!"

615,Dolly Parton , Wildflowers,"The hills were alive with wildflowers And I was as wild, even wilder than they For at least I could run, they just died in the sun And I refused to just wither in placeJust a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow So I ran fearing not where I'd go When a flower grows wild, it can always survive Wildflowers don't care where they growAnd the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew Were content to be lost in the crowd They were common and close, I had no room for growth I wanted so much to branch outI uprooted myself from home ground and left Took my dreams and I took to the road When a flower grows wild, it can always survive Wildflowers don't care where they growI grew up fast and wild and I never felt right In a garden so different from me I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone So the garden, one day, set me freeHitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend I just let him decide where we'd go When a flower grows wild, it can always survive Wildflowers don't care where they grow"
